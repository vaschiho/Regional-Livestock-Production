# Regional Livestock Production Analysis in Africa

## Overview
This project explores and analyzes the trends of livestock production across different regions in Africa, focusing on key livestock products like meat, eggs, hides, milk, and fat. Using data sourced from the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**, the analysis aims to uncover insights into regional variations, production patterns, and potential areas of growth.

The dataset used is restricted to African regions, and various statistical analyses, including **hypothesis testing** and **confidence intervals**, are applied to evaluate the significance of differences between regions.

## Project Goals
The main objective of this project is to:
- Identify **regional differences** in livestock production within Africa.
- Explore the production levels of key livestock products such as meat, eggs, hides, milk, and fat.
- Perform **statistical analysis** to determine if certain regions dominate in livestock production.
- Visualize the data in a way that highlights key trends and findings.

## Meat Production

The top producers of meat in 2022 were **West Africa** and **North Africa**, with **goat** and **sheep** meat leading production. **Central** and **Southern Africa** had relatively low meat production compared to these regions.

#### Meat production is divided into two categories:
1. **Pure meat** from livestock animals.
2. **Edible offal**, which refers to the internal organs of butchered animals, also known as organ meats.

![Meat Production](./image/meat.png)

**Sheep meat**, **goat meat**, **cattle meat**, and **pig meat** have been the major contributors to meat production, making up **97.55%** of the total meat market. Over the years, sheep meat was the leading meat product, but it experienced a steady decline of about **1.1%** since 2020. In contrast, goat meat saw steady growth, topping the meat production chart in 2022 with **133 million tonnes**, followed by cattle meat at **42 million tonnes** and pig meat at **41 million tonnes**.

### Edible Offal vs Pure Meat

Both **pure meat** and **edible offal** have shown similar production patterns, contributing significantly to the livestock sector in Africa.

### Top Meat Producers in Africa

In 2022, **Nigeria** was the highest producer of meat, accounting for around **17%** of Africa's total production. Other major producers included **Ethiopia** and **Sudan** (9% each), **Chad** (5%), and **Malawi** (6%).

## Statistical Analysis
I carried out statistical tests, such as the **chi-square test**, to compare the regional distribution of livestock production. For regions like West Africa and East Africa, **z-tests** were applied to compare proportions of specific livestock products.


## Global Contribution of Livestock to GDP

Globally, the livestock sector, including meat, milk, hides, egg and fat production, plays a significant role in agriculture and contributes greatly to many countries' GDP. In Africa, the livestock sector is particularly important for rural livelihoods, food security, and nutrition. It contributes significantly to national economies, especially in countries like **Nigeria**, **Ethiopia**, and **Sudan**, where livestock production is a major agricultural activity.

According to the **Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)**, livestock production in Africa makes up a substantial part of the agricultural GDP, contributing between **10-15%** of the continent's total GDP, depending on the country. The sector also provides employment and supports over **350 million** people across the continent, many of whom rely on livestock for their livelihoods.

This analysis highlights not only the importance of livestock production within Africa but also its critical role in the global agricultural sector. By understanding regional production trends, stakeholders can make informed decisions to improve production efficiency, boost exports, and enhance food security across the continent.

## Conclusion
This analysis offers valuable insights into livestock production across Africa, highlighting the role of different regions in producing key livestock products like meat, eggs, and hides. It also identified growth patterns and significant regional differences in production, which can inform future agricultural policies and investments. Understanding these trends helps provide a foundation for improving livestock management, food security, and economic stability in Africa.
